# Personal NeoVim Configuration
This is a repository to make the installation of my NeoVim configuration easier.

## Install
To install , ``cd`` into your configuration directory and run the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Santiago-Silvera/nvim
```

> Note: this config does not work very well with the default MacOS terminal and on windows you should install a nerd font for icons.

After cloning, just open `nvim` and lazy package manager will install all dependencies for you.
It is recommended that you have installed Node.js and gcc. Also running `:checkhealth` is a good idea.
